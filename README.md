# PI-Scape
A fully designed 2D (ongoing) low-level game project based on @Pygame library. All of the game art, sprites, and animations are personally made via Aseprite, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe After-Effects, and are free to use !

- REPOSITORY      : Clone the game repo in your F:/ directory (Windows) directly. Use your IDE to run the Main.py file
